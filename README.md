## Status when starting this challenge

I have finished ML specialization and applied techniques, but I have still not finished the first part of the book. I am working on that and I will start the challenge from today (March 2, 2025).

## Day 1
I revised Supervised learning notes that I made during ML couse

------

## Day 2
I learned basic about NN:
1. Nodes
2. Layers
3. Activation functions
4. Cost functions
5. Forward propagation
6. Chain rule in derivative
7. Backward propagation

I have Prepared Notes about NN that can be found in my linkedin post. [Here!!!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rishikesh0_01-baisc-of-nn-activity-7306525249238417408-3oYL?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAETVr1QBKissH85Z72imh8aNIFL6Kap-kp0)

Together with this I have also started implementing NN form scratch but it is not yet completed. This is my goal for next day
